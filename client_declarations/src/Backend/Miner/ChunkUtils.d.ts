 * An aligned chunk is one whose corner's coordinates are multiples of its side length, and its side
 * length is a power of two between {@link MIN_CHUNK_SIZE} and {@link MAX_CHUNK_SIZE} inclusive.
 *
 * "Aligned" chunks is that they can be merged into other aligned chunks. Non-aligned chunks cannot
 * always be merged into squares. The reason we care about merging is that merging chunks allows us
 * to represent more world-space using fewer chunks. This saves memory at both runtime and
 * storage-time. Therefore, we only store aligned chunks.
 *
 * As an example, chunks with any corner at (0, 0) are always aligned. A chunk with side length 4 is
 * aligned if it's on (4, 4), (8, 12), but not (4, 6).
 *
 * This function returns the other three chunks with the same side length of the given chunk, such
 * that the four chunks, if merged, would result in an "aligned" chunk whose side length is double
 * the given chunk.

 * contains all of the "sibling" chunks to this new chunk, then instead of adding it, we merge the 4
 * sibling chunks, and add the merged chunk to the map and remove the existing sibling chunks. This
 * function is recursive, which means that if the newly created merged chunk can also be merged with
 * its siblings, then we merge it, add the new larger chunk, and also remove the previously existing
 * sibling chunks.
 *
 * The maximum chunk size is represented by the `maxChunkSize` parameter (which has to be a power of
 * two). If no `maxChunkSize` parameter is provided, then there is no maxmimum chunk size, meaning
 * that chunks will be merged until no further merging is possible.
 *
